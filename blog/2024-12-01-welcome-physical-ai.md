# Welcome to the Future of Robotics Education

We're thrilled to announce the launch of our **AI-Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This comprehensive curriculum is designed for the next generation of roboticists and AI engineers.

## What You'll Learn

This course covers the complete stack for building intelligent humanoid robots:

### 🔌 Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System
Master **ROS 2**, the middleware that connects sensors to actuators. You'll build your first "Hello Robot" node and create a bipedal URDF model.

### 🪞 Module 2: The Digital Twin
Learn to simulate robots before deploying to hardware. We cover **Gazebo** physics simulation, **Unity** for high-fidelity rendering, and comprehensive sensor simulation.

### 🧠 Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain
Dive into **NVIDIA Isaac** for perception and navigation. You'll implement Visual SLAM and master the Nav2 navigation stack.

### 🎯 Module 4: Vision-Language-Action
The capstone module where everything comes together. Build a voice-commanded autonomous humanoid using **OpenAI Whisper** and **LLMs**.

## Why AI-Native?

This textbook is specifically designed for **AI-assisted learning**:

- Use Claude Code alongside the material
- Every concept has working code examples
- Machine-readable structure for future AI agents
