## 🧠 Why AI-Native Learning?

This textbook is built from the ground up for a new era of education. Here's what makes it different:

### 🤝 Human-Agent-Robot Symbiosis

We don't just teach you about robots—we teach you to **work alongside AI agents** (like Claude) to build, debug, and optimize robotic systems. This mirrors the real-world workflow you'll encounter in your career.

### 📚 AI-Readable Content

Every chapter is structured with:
- **Clear learning objectives** that AI tutors can assess
- **Interactive code blocks** that can be executed and modified
- **Semantic markup** that enables AI-powered search and navigation

### 💻 Practical, Deployable Code

No theoretical abstractions here. Every concept includes working code examples you can run, modify, and deploy to real hardware.
